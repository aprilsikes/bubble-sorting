__You will write your solution in `lib/bubble.js`__

## Approaching the problem

* Write pseudo code to help you understand and organize the problem
* start with the smallest sample possible and go from there.

__EXAMPLE:__

__#1 Sorts an array of 2__

```js
var expectedInput = [5, 2];
var expectedOutput = [2, 5];
```
__#2 Sorts an array of 3__

```js
var expectedInput = [5, 2, 1];
var expectedOutput = [1, 2, 5];
```
__Until Finally__

```js
var expectedInput = [5, 2, 4, 3, 8, 10, 1, 0];
var expectedOutput = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10];
```

__TESTS:__

If you want to test drive your solution, testing is all wired up for you with one initial test included. You'll have to write the rest on your own.
